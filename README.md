# Python Automation Projects

This repository contains a collection of small to medium Python automation tools I'm building to improve my scripting, API integration, and workflow automation skills.

Each project is contained in its own folder with a README describing its purpose and usage.

## Projects
Folder: `multiclipboard/`
A simple local clipboard automation project that allows saving and loading text snippets with Python.

Folder: `WeatherFetcher/`
A command-line tool that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
It supports `.env` API key loading, logs outputs to CSV, and includes error handling.
